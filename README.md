> *A [/ˈflaʃənˌpɔst/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Flaschenpost) is a &bdquo;message written on a scrap of paper, rolled-up and put in an empty bottle and set adrift on the ocean; traditionally, a method used by castaways to advertise their distress to the outside world&rdquo;.* (from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/message_in_a_bottle))

## Installation

### As Node.js module

```bash
$ npm install flaschenpost
```

### As CLI

```bash
$ npm install -g flaschenpost
```

## Quick start

First you need to integrate flaschenpost into your application.

```javascript
const flaschenpost = require('flaschenpost');
```

### Using a logger

Next, call the `getLogger` function to acquire a logger. If you don't provide a parameter flaschenpost identifies the caller automatically.

```javascript
const logger = flaschenpost.getLogger();
```

In rare cases you need to specify the caller manually, e.g. if you wrap flaschenpost in your own logging module. In these cases, provide `__filename` as parameter.

```javascript
const logger = flaschenpost.getLogger(__filename);
```

Then you can use the functions `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info` and `debug` to write log messages. Simply provide the message you want to log as a parameter.

```javascript
logger.info('App started.');
```

#### Handling meta data

If you want to provide additional meta data, use an object as second parameter.

```javascript
logger.info('App started.', {
  name: 'foo',
  bar: {
    baz: 23
  }
});
```

#### Defining the log target

Unlike other loggers, flaschenpost only supports logging to the console. This is because a modern cloud-based application [never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream](http://12factor.net/logs).

When you are running an application using a TTY, the log messages will be written in a human-readable format. As soon as you redirect the output to a file or over the network, log messages are automatically written as JSON objects that can easily be processed by other tools.

#### Setting a custom host

By default, flaschenpost uses the current host's host name in log messages. If you want to change the host name being used, call the `use` function.

```javascript
flaschenpost.use('host', 'example.com');
```

### Enabling and disabling log levels

By default, only the log levels `fatal`, `error`, `warn` and `info` are printed to the console. If you want to change this, set the environment variable `LOG_LEVELS` to the comma-separated list of desired log levels.

```bash
$ export LOG_LEVELS=debug,info
```

If you want to enable all log levels at once, you can provide a `*` character as value for the `LOG_LEVELS` environment variable.

```bash
$ export LOG_LEVELS=*
```

### Setting custom log levels

If you want to change the default log levels, i.e. define other log levels, change colors or define which log levels are enabled by default, call the `use` function of flaschenpost.

```javascript
flaschenpost.use('levels', {
  fatal: {
    color: 'blue',
    enabled: true
  },
  error: {
    color: 'red',
    enabled: true
  },
  warn: {
    color: 'yellow',
    enabled: true
  },
  info: {
    color: 'green',
    enabled: true
  },
  debug: {
    color: 'white',
    enabled: false
  }
});
```

### Using the Express middleware

If you are writing an Express-based application and you use [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) as logger, you can easily integrate flaschenpost into it.

For that, provide the `stream` property when setting up morgan and call the `Middleware` constructor function with the desired log level.

```javascript
app.use(morgan('combined', {
  stream: new flaschenpost.Middleware('info')
}));
```

Again, in rare cases it may be necessary to provide the file name of the caller on your own.

```javascript
app.use(morgan('combined', {
  stream: new flaschenpost.Middleware('info', __filename)
}));
```

### Uncorking a flaschenpost

From time to time you may want to inspect log files that contain messages created by flaschenpost. For that, run the CLI tool and provide the log file via stdin.

```bash
$ flaschenpost < foo.log
```

## Running the build

To build this module use [roboter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roboter).

```bash
$ bot build-server
```
