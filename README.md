# flaschenpost

flaschenpost is a logger for cloud-based applications.

> *A [/ˈflaʃənˌpɔst/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Flaschenpost) is a &bdquo;message written on a scrap of paper, rolled-up and put in an empty bottle and set adrift on the ocean; traditionally, a method used by castaways to advertise their distress to the outside world&rdquo;.* (from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/message_in_a_bottle))

## Installation

    $ npm install flaschenpost

## Quick start

First you need to integrate flaschenpost into your application.

```javascript
var flaschenpost = require('flaschenpost');
```

You need to provide the name and version of your application. For that call the `use` function and specify an appropriate object.

```javascript
flaschenpost.use('module', {
  name: 'foo',
  version: '0.0.1'
});
```

Please note that if you specify additional properties, these properties are ignored. This allows you to hand over your `package.json` file.

```javascript
flaschenpost.use('module', require('./package.json'));
```

### Using a logger

Once you have set up flaschenpost, you can call its `getLogger` function to acquire a logger.

```javascript
var logger = flaschenpost.getLogger();
```

If you want to use multiple loggers in your application, you may provide a string as parameter for `getLogger` that identifies the source from where you send log messages. This *may* be the name of the current file.

```javascript
var logger = flaschenpost.getLogger(__filename);
```

Then you can use the functions `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info` and `debug` to write log messages. Simply provide the message you want to log as a parameter.

```javascript
logger.info('App started.');
```

#### Formatting log messages

If you want to use placeholders in the log message, embrace them in double curly braces. Additionally, specify an object that contains the values.

```javascript
logger.info('App {{name}} started.', {
  name: 'foo'
});
```

You can use as many placeholders as you like. Values in the object that do not have a counterpart in the log message are ignored.

#### Handling meta data

If you want to provide additional meta data, add a `metadata` key to the parameter object and provide the meta data.

```javascript
logger.info('App {{name}} started.', {
  name: 'foo',
  metadata: {
    foo: 'bar',
    baz: 23
  }
});
```

#### Defining the log target

Unlike other loggers, flaschenpost only supports logging to the console. This is because a modern cloud-based application [never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream](http://12factor.net/logs).

When you are running an application using a TTY, the log messages will be written in a human-readable format. As soon as you redirect the output to a file or over the network, log messages are automatically written as JSON objects that can easily be processed by other tools.

### Enabling and disabling log levels

By default, only the log levels `fatal`, `error`, `warn` and `info` are printed to the console. If you want to change this, set the environment variable `LOG_LEVELS` to the comma-separated list of desired log levels.

    $ export LOG_LEVELS=debug,info

### Setting custom log levels

If you want to change the default log levels, i.e. define other log levels, change colors or define which log levels are enabled by default, call the `use` function of flaschenpost.

```javascript
flaschenpost.use('levels', {
  fatal: {
    color: 'blue',
    enabled: true
  },
  error: {
    color: 'red',
    enabled: true
  },
  warn: {
    color: 'yellow',
    enabled: true
  },
  info: {
    color: 'green',
    enabled: true
  },
  debug: {
    color: 'white',
    enabled: false
  }
});
```

### Using the Express middleware

If you are writing an Express-based application and you use [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) as logger, you can easily integrate flaschenpost into it.

For that, provide the `stream` property when setting up morgan and call the `Middleware` constructor function with the desired log level.

```javascript
app.use(morgan('combined', {
  stream: new flaschenpost.Middleware('info')
}));
```

## Converting logs into human readable format

As stated in section [Defining the log target](#defining-the-log-target), log entries are written as JSON objects if the application is not connected to a TTY. The purpose of `uncork-flaschenpost` is to convert those JSON data into a human readable format.

### Installation

In order to use the program, you must globally install flaschenpost:

    $ npm install -g flaschenpost

Please note the option `-g`.

### Quick start

After installing globally, you can easily analyze the contents of an existing log file:

    $ cat myApp.log | uncork-flaschenpost

As you can see, `uncork-flaschenpost` reads incoming log data from `stdin` and writes the converted output to console.

This allows, e.g., to save logs to file while still beeing able to read them on console:

    $ myApp | tee myApp.log | uncork-flaschenpost

## Running the build

This module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, this also analyses the code. To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed flaschenpost and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.

    $ grunt
